TO DEPLOY WITH TRUFFLE:
    Put 1_deploy_ChainPark.sol in the migrations folder of a truffle project
    Configure truffle-config.js to use the correct network (if not done already)
    Run truffle migrate
    DONE!
    1_deploy_ChainPark.js is a script that will first deploy UBParkingCredits.sol (ERC20 Contract)
    and then deploy ChainPark.sol (Parking Contract) with the address of UBParkingCredits as a parameter.
    After both contracts are deployed, we call setChainPark() on UBParkingCredits.sol to set the address of ChainPark.sol.
    Now our two contracts are deployed and linked together!


TO DEPLOY WITH REMIX:
    Load and compile both contracts into remix IDE
    First deploy UBParkingCredits.sol
    Then deploy ChainPark.sol with the following parameters:
        _lotMaxCapacities = [9999, 8, 10, 211, 432, 54, 28, 543, 234, 62, 54, 123, 431, 213, 321, 321, 123, 123, 321, 1234, 124, 1233, 213, 123, 321, 234, 321]
        _ubpcContractAddr = <address of UBParkingCredits.sol>
        _maxFee = 1000000000000000000
        _dailyIncome = 2000000000000000000
        _staffLot = 2

    After ChainPark.sol is deployed, call setChainPark() on UBParkingCredits.sol to set the address of ChainPark.sol.
